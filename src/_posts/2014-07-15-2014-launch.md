## Birmingham Post Business Awards Thursday,&nbsp;26&nbsp;November&nbsp;2014, the&nbsp;ICC.

**Birmingham is bouncing back&hellip; now the Birmingham&nbsp;Post is celebrating alongside businesses who have helped to return the region to growth by launching our 2014 Birmingham&nbsp;Post Business&nbsp;Awards.**

If your business had a good 2013/14, launched a new product, enjoyed success exporting, was active in the community or contributed to improving the environment, then there&rsquo;s at least one business award category for you to enter. No matter how small or large your company is and no matter what sector you operate in, if you&rsquo;ve achieved something you&rsquo;re proud of, we want to hear from you.

We want companies to showcase the skills and strengths of the West Midlands business and professional community in front of their peers and for those who are awarded to proudly boast that they are a Birmingham&nbsp;Post Business&nbsp;Award winner.

Being shortlisted is a great way to raise your company&rsquo;s profile&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;your achievements will be highlighted in front of more than 800 of the city&rsquo;s movers and shakers on Thursday,&nbsp;26&nbsp;November&nbsp;2014, in the biggest&ndash;ever Post business awards, which are returning to the ICC.
It will also come with coverage in a special post-awards supplement in the Birmingham&nbsp;Post. A &lsquo;Company of the Year&rsquo; award will also be presented to one of the shortlisted companies on the night of the award ceremony, a great accolade for a West Midlands business.
