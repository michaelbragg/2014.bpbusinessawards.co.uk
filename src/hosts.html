        <h3>Ed Balls</h3>
        <h4>Keynote Speaker</h4>
        <p>Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will deliver the keynote speech at this year&rsquo;s Birmingham Post Business Awards.</p>
        <p>Mr Balls will address the region&rsquo;s premier festival of business on November 26.</p>
        <p>The Labour minister will speak to 800 decision-makers and businesspeople at the ICC event – just days before the Government delivers the final Autumn Statement before the General Election.</p>
        <p>Mr Balls said he was delighted to play a part in the awards, which have already attracted dozens of applications from successful businesses in the region.</p>
        <p>He said: &ldquo;Birmingham is home to many of our country&rsquo;s best and most exciting businesses.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I am looking forward to hearing about the city&rsquo;s top businesses and about the businesspeople driving the region forward.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I want to congratulate the Birmingham Post for this great event showcasing the city&rsquo;s business talents.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>This year&rsquo;s event will be themed around &ldquo;Birmingham bouncing back&rdquo; in light of a major 12 months of growth which have seen more people in work and the local economy in growth.</p>
        <p>The likes of Jaguar Land Rover, JLL, Wesleyan and Turkish Airlines are already lined up as sponsors for the event, which is always the highlight of the city&rsquo;s business calendar.</p>
        <p>The different categories include small business, manufacturing, environmental, legal, finance, communications, outstanding professional, property, technology &amp; digital, retail, company of the year and the lifetime achievement award.</p>
        <p>Being shortlisted is a great way to raise your company&rsquo;s profile as its achievements will be highlighted in front of hundreds of the city&rsquo;s movers and shakers on the night of the awards.</p>
        <p>Graeme Brown, regional head of business at Post publisher BPM Media, said Mr Balls would be a big draw for firms.</p>
        <p>He said: &ldquo;Ed Balls is the ideal person to speak at this year&rsquo;s event. With a matter of days before the autumn statement and months until a General Election, the future for the country&rsquo;s economy will be on the top of the agenda.&rdquo;</p>

        <h3>Lee Hurst</h3>
        <h4>Presenter</h4>
        <p>Stand-up comedian Lee Hurst has promised to add a touch of irreverence to proceedings after being unveiled as the presenter of this year&rsquo;s Birmingham Post Business Awards.</p>
        <p>The comedian, best known as a former team member on the BBC comedy quiz They Think It&rsquo;s All Over, is a popular awards host – and said the secret to his success was doing no preparation at all.</p>
        <p>He said improvising is key to his act and pledged to &ldquo;make sure everyone has a good time&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>The announcement comes a week after Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls was unveiled as the keynote speaker at the awards.</p>
        <p>This event promises to be the biggest and best yet with up to 800 businesspeople and decision-makers expected at the ICC on November 26.</p>
        <p>Mr Hurst said: &ldquo;I am very irreverent. I don&rsquo;t respect any awards I do, which sounds odd, but I see it as my job to make sure everyone has a good time.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That is what I have been brought in for. If you are looking for someone to just stand there and stick to the script then a television presenter is the right person – they are used to reading from an autocue all day.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Mr Hurst was a regular face on television in the 1990s before focusing on stand-up and running comedy clubs.</p>
        <p>He said he will try to stay as far away from a script as possible.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My approach is don&rsquo;t do anything, just turn up,&rdquo; he said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to have too much information because I find you don&rsquo;t improvise.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t rehearse – I just turn up and do the basic logistical stuff but I find the less I know the better.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Post editor Stacey Barnfield said: &ldquo;Lee Hurst is one of the most sought-after presenters on the circuit. Not only is he a great laugh, he is very experienced with events like this and will bring a real light-hearted, irreverent, atmosphere to this year&rsquo;s business awards.&rdquo;</p>
