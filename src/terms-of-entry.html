  <h1 class="gamma heading--main">Terms of Entry</h1>

  <p>All entries must relate to activity during the financial year April 2012 - March 2013.</p>

  <p>Where appropriate, applications are welcomed and encouraged from businesses of all sizes, educational establishments and other public bodies. There are separate entry criteria for each of the award categories, however award sponsors are prohibited from entering their own sponsored category.</p>

  <p>The awards are open to all companies and organisations with a significant presence within the West Midlands Region. However, applications will also be considered from businesses based on the fringe of the West Midlands area, as long as a significant interest within the area can be demonstrated, eg customer base, workforce, etc.</p>

  <p>The Birmingham Post will assign a judging panel with an appropriate chairperson. Every effort will be made to give feedback to entrants, although no specific correspondence will be entered into. The decision of the judging panel for each award and on all associated matters is final. The judging panel will have the opportunity to see all entries in each category (but a number of specific entries will be highlighted to the judges for their consideration).</p>

  <p>All entries must be received by 5.00pm on Thursday, 31&nbsp;July&nbsp;2014. They can be submitted via The Birmingham Post Business Awards website <a href="http://www.bpbusinessawards.co.uk/">bpbusinessawards.co.uk</a>. Any supporting documentation should be posted to Claire&nbsp;Roberts, (Ref: BPBATS), Trinity&nbsp;Mirror&nbsp;Midlands, Floor&nbsp;6, Fort&nbsp;Dunlop, Fort&nbsp;Parkway, Birmingham, B24&nbsp;9FF. Please clearly mark as to which entry the information is to be included with and which category. When posting supporting documentation, please submit 7 copies of everything.</p>

  <p>Information submitted, apart from financial and employee data, may be used within our publications and on event material - therefore please ensure that all documentation submitted is not of a confidential or sensitive nature.</p>

  <p>A shortlist of the 3 or 4 top entries for each category will be decided by the judging panel and shortlisted companies and organisations will be announced in The Birmingham Post on Thursday, 8&nbsp;August&nbsp;2014.</p>

  <p>The awards will be presented at a gala awards dinner on Thursday, 17&nbsp;October&nbsp;2014 at Edgbaston Stadium.</p>
